    "# Cyber Attack Simulation on Content Moderation APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation evaluates risks against two separate versions of a content moderation API. Version `v1` corresponds to the first implementation, while version `v2` represents the improved and secured variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective: OWASP API Security Simulation\n",
    "This study simulates and remediates critical API vulnerabilities defined in the OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023) and OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model. We contrast two API implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- v1 (Vulnerable): Demonstrates Insecure Design and a lack of defense-in-depth, exhibiting vulnerabilities such as Broken Authentication and Unrestricted Resource Consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "- v2 (Secured): Implements Security by Design principles, featuring robust input validation, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and rate limiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Domain\n",
    "The APIs serve the content moderation domain, utilizing a linear SVM for multi-label classification (Hate speech, Violence, Incitement) and TinyLLama for model explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Model\n",
    "Both API versions implement a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for **multi-label prediction**, allowing each input to be assigned to one or more of six content categories:\n",
    "- Hate speech  \n",
    "- Violence  \n",
    "- Incitement  \n",
    "- Graphic content  \n",
    "- Dangerous individuals and organizations  \n",
    "- Other  \n",
    "\n",
    "For model interpretability and explanation, `TinyLLama` is integrated into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we conduct a series of API-level and adversarial attacks targeting both the endpoints and the underlying large language model, analyzing their behavior and resilience.\n"
